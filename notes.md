# Singleton

# Factory Design Pattern

###  Factory Method Design pattern
When there is superclass and multiple subclasses and we want to get object of subclasses based on input and requirements.

Then we create factory class which takes the responsibility of creating object of class based on input.

## Advantages Of Factory Design Patten

1. Focus on creating object for interface rather than implementation.
2. Loose coupling, more robust code.


# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

Factory of fatory

# Builder

while creating object, when object contains many attributes there are many problems:

1. we have to pass too many arguments 
2. some parameters might be optional
3. fatory class takes all the responsibility for creating the object. If the object is heavy them all the compleity is part of factory class.

so in Builder patter be created objects step by step and finally return final object with desired values of attributes.  

# Prototype Design Pattern

The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch,because creating new object may be costly.
This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when object creation is a heavy process._
